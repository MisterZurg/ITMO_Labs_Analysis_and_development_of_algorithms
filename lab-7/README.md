# Task 7. Algorithms on graphs. Tools for network analysis
## Goal
*The use of the network analysis software Gephi*

## Problems and methods
1. *Download and install Gephi from https://gephi.org/*.
2. *Choose a network dataset from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ with number of nodes at most 10,000. You are free to choose the network nature and type (un/weighted, un/directed)*.
3. *Change the format of the dataset for that accepted by Gephi (.csv, .xls, .edges, etc.), if necessary*.
4. *Upload and process the dataset in Gephi. Check if the parameters of import and data are correct*.
5. *Obtain a graph layout of at least two different types*.
6. *Calculate available network measures in Statistics provided by Gephi*.
7. *Analyze the results for the network chosen*.

*While performing the work, screenshot the main steps you are doing and insert in the report*
